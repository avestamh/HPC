## In these repo I brought some of the code that I was using between 2016 to 2021 to run simulation on local cluster and XSEDE 
## slurm_charmm_job.sh
This script sets up and runs a CHARMM simulation for the GFP protein, utilizing SLURM for job scheduling.
It defines necessary environment variables, input parameters, and executes the simulation with MPI.

## run_slurm_in_comet.sh
this code is used to run slurm on comet
